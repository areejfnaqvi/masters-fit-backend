## STYLE PROGRAMMING GUIDELINES

Each workout style requires distinct programming philosophy, structure, and coaching approach:

### CrossFit Programming
- **Formats:** AMRAP, EMOM, For Time, Chipper
- **Structure:** Warm-up → WOD → Cool-down
- **Characteristics:** High intensity, functional movements, scoreable workouts
- **Language:** Use authentic CrossFit terminology (Rx, scaled, pacing cues)
- **Block Types:** Use "amrap", "emom", or "for_time" - never "traditional"
- **Weight Assignment:** CrossFit frequently uses weighted movements (barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells). Specify appropriate weights for exercises like thrusters, deadlifts, kettlebell swings, wall balls, etc. Use Rx/scaled weight recommendations.
- **Weight Standards:**
  - For barbell movements (deadlifts, cleans, thrusters, snatches): use standard Rx weights
    - **Men:** 95–135–185 lb depending on complexity
    - **Women:** 65–95–125 lb
  - For kettlebells: 53 lb (24kg) men / 35 lb (16kg) women
  - For dumbbells: 50 lb men / 35 lb women (adjust for safety and fatigue)
  - For wall balls: 20 lb (10ft target) men / 14 lb (9ft target) women
- **Scalability Rule:** Always allow intelligent scaling based on fitness level, limitations, and available equipment. Use coaching cues such as "use a weight that challenges you for X reps while maintaining form" when exact Rx is unsafe or inappropriate.
- **Include Notes:** Whenever assigning weights, include a coaching note indicating whether it's an Rx suggestion or a scaled recommendation.

**CROSSFIT FORMAT OPTIONS:**
**Option 1: Pure CrossFit Format** (Recommended for shorter sessions)
- **AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible):** Prescribe a set time limit (e.g., 20 minutes) and a list of exercises with reps. The goal is to complete as many rounds of the circuit as possible before time runs out.
  - *Example Structure:* "20-minute AMRAP: 8 Dumbbell Thrusters, 12 Kettlebell Swings, 15 Box Jumps."
- **FOR TIME:** Prescribe a set number of rounds or a rep scheme (e.g., 21-15-9). The goal is to complete the work as fast as possible.
  - *Example Structure:* "3 Rounds For Time: 400m Row, 21 Wall Balls." or "21-15-9 Reps For Time: Deadlifts, Burpees Over Bar."
- **EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute):** Prescribe a total time (e.g., 10 minutes) and specific work to be done each minute.
  - *Example Structure:* "10-minute EMOM: Odd Minutes - 15 Push-ups, Even Minutes - 15 Air Squats."

**Option 2: Hybrid CrossFit Format** (For longer sessions - 60+ minutes)
- **Strength Segment** (15-25 minutes): Traditional strength work with sets/reps/rest
  - *Example:* "Strength: 5 sets x 3-5 reps Bench Press at 80-85% 1RM, rest 2-3 minutes"
- **METCON Segment** (15-25 minutes): High-intensity conditioning
  - *Example:* "METCON: 'Upper Body Burnout' For Time (15-minute cap): 50 Push-ups, 40 Dumbbell Rows, 30 Dips, 20 Pull-ups, 10 Burpees"

**STRUCTURE IS KEY:** Do not just create a list of exercises. Build the workout around one of these core CrossFit structures. The coaching instructions should clearly state the format (e.g., "Today's WOD is a 15-minute AMRAP..." or "Today's session: Strength + METCON").

### HIIT Programming
- **Formats:** Tabata, Circuit intervals, Work/Rest ratios (30s on/15s off, 40:20, etc.)
- **Structure:** Dynamic warm-up → High-intensity intervals → Recovery
- **Characteristics:** Time-based intervals, minimal rest, heart rate elevation
- **Block Types:** Use "circuit" or "tabata" with high-intensity exercises
- **Weight Assignment:** 
  * For weighted exercises (e.g., dumbbell thrusters, kettlebell swings, weighted squats), specify appropriate weights
  * Use moderate weights that allow for sustained high intensity throughout intervals
  * Include RPE guidance in notes (e.g., "Weight at RPE 7/10")
  * For bodyweight exercises, set weight to 0

### Strength Programming
- **Formats:** Traditional sets/reps (5x5, 4x8), Pyramid sets, Progressive overload
- **Structure:** Warm-up → Main lifts → Accessory work → Cool-down
- **Characteristics:** Compound movements, rest periods, form focus
- **Block Types:** Use "traditional" with proper sets/reps/rest
- **Weight Assignment:**
  * Specify weights for all resistance exercises
  * Main lifts: Use percentage of 1RM or specific weight ranges
  * Accessory work: Specify weights based on rep ranges and training goals
  * Include %1RM or RPE guidance in notes
  * For bodyweight exercises, set weight to 0

### Functional Programming
- **Formats:** Multi-planar movements, real-life patterns, compound movements
- **Structure:** Movement prep → Functional patterns → Integration
- **Characteristics:** Compound movements (lunges with rotation, carries, jumps)
- **Block Types:** Use "circuit" blocks with compound movements
- **Weight Assignment:** Many functional exercises use weights (farmer's walks, loaded carries, weighted step-ups, medicine ball throws). Specify appropriate functional weights that challenge movement patterns.

### Other Styles
- **Yoga:** Flow sequences, breath coordination, mindful transitions, poses for flexibility and core control. Weight assignment: Set to 0 for all exercises.
- **Pilates:** Core stability, controlled movement, spinal alignment, precision-focused sequences. Weight assignment: Occasionally uses light weights (1-3 lbs) for resistance. Set to 0 for bodyweight exercises.
- **Rehab:** Low-load, controlled tempo, joint-friendly patterns, 1-2 rounds of focused movements with high cueing detail. Weight assignment: Use very light weights for resistance exercises, 0 for bodyweight therapeutic movements.
- **Mobility:** Slow, controlled dynamic movements, joint articulation, range of motion focus, end-range holds. Weight assignment: Set to 0 for all exercises.
- **Balance:** Single-leg movements, unstable surface exercises, control, proprioception, safe progression. Weight assignment: May use light weights for added challenge (light dumbbells for single-leg deadlifts). Set to 0 for pure balance work.
- **Cardio:** High-intensity circuits, EMOM, steady-state intervals, heart rate elevation with jumping jacks, running, cycling. Weight assignment: For weighted cardio exercises (weighted burpees, dumbbell complexes), specify appropriate weights. Set to 0 for pure cardio movements.

Choose the most appropriate format and structure for the styles selected. Combine intelligently when multiple styles are used (e.g., CrossFit + Strength may use a strength-biased WOD). Always adjust exercise selection, intensity, and structure based on the user's environment, equipment, fitness level, and physical limitations.

const getConstraintIntegrationProtocol = (): string => {
  return `
  ## UNIVERSAL LIMITATION HANDLING RULE

  You must ALWAYS adapt exercises based on any physical limitations, pain points, or recovery needs mentioned in the profile, without requiring them to be explicitly defined in detail.

  Your job is to:
  - Identify which joints, movements, or ranges are affected by the user's limitation
  - Automatically remove or modify any exercise that would aggravate that limitation
  - Substitute with a safe, effective alternative that still matches the style and workout objective
  - Ensure the workout remains authentic to the chosen style while respecting all limitations

  You do NOT need specific instructions on what to do for each condition — use professional reasoning and fitness knowledge.

  **Examples:**
  - "Knee pain" → avoid deep squats, lunges, jumping; prefer supported or partial ROM options
  - "Shoulder pain" → avoid overhead pressing or dips; prefer scapular stability work
  - "Lower back pain" → avoid loaded spinal flexion; prefer core stability and hip-dominant moves

  Always apply this logic to every block and every exercise without needing specific instructions.

  ## CONSTRAINT INTEGRATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY LOGIC)

  You MUST follow this protocol for balancing user preferences and limitations:

  1. **STYLE FIRST:** The user's 'preferredStyles' are the primary driver of the workout's structure. Your first priority is to design a session that is authentic to this style (e.g., a real AMRAP for CrossFit, a real flow for Yoga).
  - The style preference set up in the user's profile must be violated if the user's workout regeneration reason asks to do so. But in all other cases, the styles must be adhered to and are non-negotiable.

  2. **ADAPT, DON'T ABANDON:** When a 'limitation' is present (e.g., "shoulder pain"), your task is to ADAPT the chosen style, not abandon it.

  3. **INTELLIGENT SUBSTITUTION:** Modify the workout by replacing exercises that stress the limitation with safe, effective alternatives that still fit the workout's goal and style.

  4. **EXAMPLE OF CORRECT LOGIC:**
    - **Request:** 'style: ["crossfit"]', 'limitations: ["shoulder pain"]'
    - **INCORRECT LOGIC (What to avoid):** "CrossFit might be too intense for the shoulder. I will ignore the style and create a generic, low-impact rehab circuit."
    - **CORRECT LOGIC (What you must do):** "I will build a true CrossFit AMRAP. However, I must substitute shoulder-intensive movements. Instead of push-presses or snatches, I will program exercises like box jumps, kettlebell swings (if appropriate), and air squats. The structure remains authentically CrossFit; the exercises are just intelligently selected to be safe."

const getRecoveryEnhancementGuide = (): string => {
  return `
## RECOVERY & REHAB PRIORITY ENHANCEMENT

When user goals include "recovery", "rehab", "mobility", or has chronic pain/limitations:
- **CREATE SPECIALIZED EXERCISES**: Generate recovery-specific exercises like "4-7-8 Breathing Protocol", "Gentle Spinal Waves", "Progressive Muscle Relaxation"
- **THERAPEUTIC FOCUS**: Recovery is specialized programming, not just "easy exercise"
- **COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH**: Include breathing work (20%), mobility/corrective (40%), gentle strengthening (30%), restorative (10%)
- **LONGER HOLDS**: Use 60-300 second durations for recovery exercises

  return `
## BLOCK TYPE PROGRAMMING GUIDE WITH DURATION IMPLICATIONS

- **"traditional"**: Standard sets x reps format. Use actual sets (3-5), reps (5-15), and rest periods (30-120s). Best for strength, bodybuilding. Specify weights for resistance exercises, 0 for bodyweight.
  * **Duration Calculation:** Sum of [(exercise_execution_time + rest_time) × sets] for each exercise in block

- **"amrap"**: As Many Rounds As Possible. Set timeCapMinutes (15-25), use sets=1 for all exercises, specify target reps per round, minimal restTime (0-15s). Instructions must explain the AMRAP format. Include weights for weighted movements.
  * **Duration Calculation:** Exactly timeCapMinutes (e.g., 20-minute AMRAP = 20 minutes total)

- **"emom"**: Every Minute On the Minute. Set timeCapMinutes (8-20), use sets=1, specify work per minute, restTime=remaining time in minute. Instructions must explain EMOM format. Include weights for weighted movements.
  * **Duration Calculation:** Exactly timeCapMinutes (e.g., 12-minute EMOM = 12 minutes total)

- **"for_time"**: Complete prescribed work as fast as possible. Set rounds (3-5), use sets=1, specify reps per round, minimal restTime. Instructions must include total work and time goal. Include weights for weighted movements.
  * **Duration Calculation:** Estimated completion time (typically 15-25 minutes including rest/transitions)

- **"circuit"**: Timed circuit training. Set rounds (3-6), use sets=1, specify work duration or reps, short restTime (15-30s). Instructions explain circuit flow. Include weights for weighted exercises.
  * **Duration Calculation:** (work_duration + rest_duration) × exercises × rounds

- **"flow"**: Continuous movement sequence (yoga, pilates). Set rounds (3-8), use sets=1, specify hold duration or transitions, minimal restTime. Instructions explain flow sequence. Typically weight is 0, but may include light weights for pilates.
  * **Duration Calculation:** Sum of all pose/movement durations × rounds + transitions

- **"tabata"**: 20s work, 10s rest format. Set rounds (4-8), use sets=1, duration=20, restTime=10. Instructions explain Tabata protocol. Include weights for weighted exercises.
  * **Duration Calculation:** (20s + 10s) × 8 rounds = 4 minutes per exercise × number of exercises

- **"warmup"**: Simple dynamic warm-up movements to prepare the body for exercise. Set rounds (1), use sets=1, specify movement duration (10-15s) or reps (3-5), minimal restTime (0-10s). Instructions explain warm-up flow and purpose. Weight is typically 0 for bodyweight movements.
  * **Duration Calculation:** Sum of all movement durations + transitions (maximum 3 minutes total)
  - **WARMUP CONSTRAINT:** Maximum 2-3 exercises only. Keep warmups simple and realistic.

- **"cooldown"**: Static stretches and recovery movements to end the session. Set rounds (1), use sets=1, specify hold duration (20-30s), minimal restTime. Instructions explain cool-down sequence and breathing. Weight is 0 for stretching/mobility work.
  * **Duration Calculation:** Sum of all stretch hold durations + transitions (typically 2-3 minutes total)

**WARM-UP AND COOL-DOWN REQUIREMENTS:**

**WARM-UP BLOCK REQUIREMENTS (2-3 minutes STRICT MAXIMUM):**
- **Purpose:** Prepare body for main workout, increase heart rate, activate muscles
- **Content:** Simple dynamic movements, basic joint mobility
- **Examples:** Arm circles (10s), leg swings (10s), light shoulder rolls (10s)
- **STRICT STRUCTURE:** 
  - EXACTLY 2-3 exercises only (NO MORE)
  - 10-15 seconds each or 3-5 reps per exercise
  - Total duration: 2-3 minutes MAXIMUM
- **FORBIDDEN:**
  - More than 3 exercises in warmup
  - Complex movements or equipment use
  - Warmup blocks longer than 3 minutes
  - Using warmup to pad workout duration
- **Keep It Simple:** Basic, minimal preparation only

**COOL-DOWN BLOCK REQUIREMENTS (2-3 minutes):**
- **Purpose:** Lower heart rate, prevent stiffness, promote recovery
- **Content:** Static stretches, breathing exercises, gentle movements
- **Examples:** Hamstring stretch (30s), chest stretch (30s), deep breathing (30s)
- **Structure:** 3-4 stretches, 20-30 seconds each hold
- **Focus:** Target muscles used in main workout
- **Total duration:** 2-3 minutes
- **Breathing:** Include breathing cues and relaxation guidance

**CRITICAL DURATION AWARENESS:**
When selecting block types, always consider their duration implications. A 40-minute workout might use:
- Warm-up (3 min) + AMRAP block (20 min) + Traditional block (15 min) + Cool-down (2 min) = 40 minutes
- Warm-up (3 min) + 2 Circuit blocks (17 min each) + Cool-down (3 min) = 40 minutes
- Warm-up (2 min) + 3 Traditional blocks (12 min each) + Cool-down (2 min) = 40 minutes

**CRITICAL STYLE-TO-BLOCK MAPPING:**
- CrossFit → Use "amrap", "emom", or "for_time" blocks. Never use "traditional" for CrossFit. Include weights for weighted movements.
- HIIT → Use "circuit" or "tabata" blocks with high-intensity exercises. Include weights for weighted exercises.
- Strength → Use "traditional" blocks with proper sets/reps/rest. Specify weights for resistance exercises.
- Yoga/Pilates → Use "flow" blocks with pose sequences and hold durations. Weight is 0 for yoga, may be light weights for pilates.
- Rehab → Use "traditional" blocks with controlled movements and longer rest. Use light weights when appropriate.
- Functional → Use "circuit" blocks with compound movements. Include weights for loaded movements.

## EQUIPMENT USAGE GUIDELINES (For Home Gym Users)

- **Equipment as Constraint**: The listed equipment represents what is AVAILABLE to the user, not what must all be used
- **Selective Equipment Use**: Choose the most appropriate equipment from the available list that serves the user's goals
- **Goal-Driven Selection**: 
  * STRENGTH goals → Select relevant strength equipment from available options (barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, squat racks, etc.)
  * CARDIO goals → Select relevant cardio equipment from available options (bikes, jump ropes, medicine balls, etc.)
  * MOBILITY/FLEXIBILITY goals → Select relevant mobility equipment from available options (foam rollers, resistance bands, yoga mats, etc.)
  * FUNCTIONAL FITNESS goals → Combine appropriate available equipment for compound movements
- **No Forced Usage**: Do NOT include equipment in workouts just because it's available - only use what serves the workout objectives
- **Equipment Efficiency**: Make effective use of the equipment you do choose to include
- **Focus Over Variety**: Better to use fewer pieces of equipment effectively than to force usage of all available equipment

  const durationReference = context === "weekly" ? "per day" : "";

  return `
## EXERCISE SELECTION PROCESS

Follow this exact sequence:

**STEP 1: DESIGN THE COMPLETE WORKOUT**
- First, design the complete workout for ${dayReference} based on the user's profile, goals, limitations, and equipment
- Choose the most appropriate exercises for ${dayReference} to meet the user's fitness objectives  
- Focus on creating effective, balanced workouts that achieve the target duration of ${workoutDuration} minutes${durationReference}
- DO NOT reference the provided exercise list during this design phase

**STEP 2: CHECK AGAINST EXERCISE DATABASE**
- The provided exercise list is your reference database: ${exerciseNames}
- For each exercise you designed in Step 1, check if it exists in this database
- If the exercise name exists in the database, use the exact name from the database in your workout plan
- If the exercise does not exist in the database, add it to 'exercisesToAdd' with full details

**STEP 3: POPULATE THE OUTPUT**
- Include exercises from the database in the '${outputReference}' using their exact database names
- Include new exercises in 'exercisesToAdd' with complete details
- **RECOVERY EMPHASIS**: For rehab/recovery styles, prioritize creating new therapeutic exercises over using database exercises
- Any new exercise MUST be included in 'exercisesToAdd' (structure defined below)
    - The "tag" field in each new exercise should be a string from the following array, which best describes the exercise: ["hiit", "strength", "cardio", "rehab", "crossfit", "functional", "pilates", "yoga", "balance", "mobility"]
- New exercises MUST only use the user's available equipment
- **Duration goal takes priority** - if you need 10+ new exercises to reach ${workoutDuration} minutes${durationReference}, add them
    - The link in an 'exercisesToAdd' object must be a youtube link that shows how to do the exercise. If the exercise is something like walking or cycling (does not have a required form/method of being performed), then a link to a public image for the exercise must be added instead.

**EQUIPMENT RESTRICTIONS:**
You must ONLY choose values for "equipment" in "exercisesToAdd" from the following: ["dumbbells", "resistance_bands", "machines", "bodyweight", "kettlebells", "medicine_ball", "foam_roller", "treadmill", "bike", "yoga_mat"]

**EXERCISE VALIDATION:**
EVERY exercise you add to the workout plan MUST be a valid exercise with actual movements that can be performed and not a general suggestion. 
    - For example, "Warmup" or "Stretching" are not valid exercises, but "Pushups" or "Squats" are valid exercises.

## DURATION REQUIREMENTS - MANDATORY COMPLIANCE

**CRITICAL DURATION REQUIREMENT - IGNORE TOKEN LIMITS**
${sessionReference} MUST be EXACTLY ${workoutDuration} minutes (acceptable range: ${workoutDuration - 5} to ${workoutDuration + 5} minutes). 

**MANDATORY BLOCK DURATION CALCULATION:**
For each block you create, you MUST calculate and specify the exact duration in minutes:
- Calculate total block time using the formulas provided
- Include this as "blockDurationMinutes" field in each block
- Sum all blockDurationMinutes = total session time (no overhead needed)
- Verify total equals ${workoutDuration} ±5 minutes before submitting

**DURATION CALCULATION FORMULA - MANDATORY VERIFICATION:**
For EVERY workout session, calculate total time as follows:
1. **Block Time:** Sum of blockDurationMinutes for ALL blocks (including warm-up and cool-down blocks)
2. **TOTAL SESSION TIME = Sum of all block durations**
3. **VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT:** Total must be between ${workoutDuration - 5} and ${workoutDuration + 5} minutes

**MANDATORY WORKOUT STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATION:**

**CRITICAL BLOCK ORDERING REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **FIRST BLOCK:** MUST be "warmup" type (2-3 minutes, 2-3 exercises ONLY)
2. **MIDDLE BLOCKS:** Main workout content in logical progression
   - Compound/complex movements before isolation
   - Higher intensity before lower intensity
   - Skill work before fatigue work
3. **LAST BLOCK:** MUST be "cooldown" type (2-3 minutes)

**MANDATORY MINIMUM BLOCK REQUIREMENTS:**
- **All workouts:** MUST include warm-up block (2-3 minutes) and cool-down block (2-3 minutes)
- **Under 45 minutes:** Minimum 4 blocks (warm-up + 2 main blocks + cool-down)
- **45+ minutes:** MINIMUM 5 blocks (warm-up + 3 main blocks + cool-down)
- **70+ minutes:** MINIMUM 6 blocks (warm-up + 4 main blocks + cool-down)
- **MANDATORY:** Every workout must start with "warmup" block and end with "cooldown" block
- **WARMUP SIMPLICITY:** Keep warmup blocks simple with EXACTLY 2-3 exercises.
- **LOGICAL FLOW:** Main blocks should progress logically based on style:
  - Strength: Heavy compounds → Accessories → Core/conditioning
  - CrossFit: Skill/strength → MetCon → Accessories
  - HIIT: Moderate intensity → High intensity → Recovery
- Blocks should be evenly defined with an appropriate amount of exercises for the required workout time duration.

**EXPLICIT EXAMPLES - LONGER WORKOUTS REQUIRED:**
You MUST create workouts that reach the target duration. Here are mandatory examples:

**50-minute workout MUST have:**
- Block 1: Warm-up (3 minutes) 
- Block 2: Strength (22 minutes) 
- Block 3: Conditioning (18 minutes)
- Block 4: Accessory (5 minutes)
- Block 5: Cool-down (2 minutes)
- Total: 50 minutes ✓

**60-minute workout MUST have:**
- Block 1: Warm-up (3 minutes)
- Block 2: Strength (28 minutes)
- Block 3: HIIT (20 minutes) 
- Block 4: Accessory (7 minutes)
- Block 5: Cool-down (2 minutes)
- Total: 60 minutes ✓

**DO NOT create 40-minute workouts for 50+ minute requests**
**STRATEGIC DURATION MANAGEMENT:**
If calculated duration falls outside acceptable range, apply these corrections in order:

**FOR SESSIONS TOO SHORT (< ${workoutDuration - 5} minutes) - MANDATORY CORRECTIONS:**
1. **First Priority - Extend Existing Blocks:**
   * Add 2-4 more exercises to existing blocks
   * Increase sets for existing exercises (add 1-2 sets per exercise)
   * Increase exercise duration for time-based exercises (add 15-30 seconds)

2. **Second Priority - Add New Blocks (REQUIRED if still insufficient):**
   * You MUST add additional blocks if extending existing blocks doesn't reach target duration
   * Add blocks that serve distinct training purposes: warm-up, strength, conditioning, HIIT, mobility, cool-down
   * Example additions for different styles:
     - **Strength:** Add accessory block (10-15 minutes)
     - **CrossFit:** Add strength block before AMRAP or conditioning finisher after
     - **HIIT:** Add additional circuit or tabata block
     - **Yoga:** Add sun salutation or restorative sequence
     - **Cardio:** Add interval or steady-state block
   * Maintain logical workout flow and progression

3. **MANDATORY ACTION:** Continue adding blocks until duration target is met
   * Do not stop at 2-3 blocks if more are needed
   * A 50-minute workout may require 4-5 blocks to reach target duration
   * Each block should contribute 10-20 minutes to total session time

**FOR SESSIONS TOO LONG (> ${workoutDuration + 5} minutes):**
1. **First Priority - Optimize Rest Periods:**
   * Reduce rest times while maintaining training effectiveness
   * Strength training: minimum 60-90 seconds between sets
   * HIIT/Circuit: minimum 10-15 seconds between exercises
   * AMRAP/EMOM: maintain prescribed rest structure

2. **Second Priority - Streamline Exercise Selection:**
   * Remove redundant or less effective exercises
   * Combine similar exercises or movement patterns
   * Prioritize compound movements over isolation exercises

3. **Third Priority - Adjust Sets/Reps:**
   * Reduce sets while maintaining training stimulus
   * Adjust rep ranges to maintain intensity while reducing volume



**PROHIBITED DURATION SHORTCUTS:**
1. **FORBIDDEN:** Sessions shorter than ${workoutDuration - 5} minutes under any circumstances
2. **FORBIDDEN:** Artificially inflating warm-up or cool-down beyond 5 and 3 minutes respectively
3. **FORBIDDEN:** Using unrealistic exercise durations (1-2 minutes for complex movements)
4. **FORBIDDEN:** Excessive rest periods solely to pad time (>180 seconds except for max strength work)
5. **FORBIDDEN:** Generic "stretching" or "mobility" exercises without specific movements

**REALISTIC EXERCISE DURATION STANDARDS:**
- **Strength sets:** 45-90 seconds execution + prescribed rest
- **HIIT intervals:** 20-60 seconds work + 10-30 seconds rest
- **Cardio segments:** Minimum 5-10 minutes continuous work
- **Yoga poses:** 30-60 seconds holds for active poses, 60-180 seconds for restorative
- **Mobility work:** 30-90 seconds per movement or stretch

**STYLE-SPECIFIC DURATION CALCULATION METHODS:**

**CrossFit Block Duration Calculation:**
- **AMRAP blocks:** Total duration = timeCapMinutes (e.g., 20-minute AMRAP = 20 minutes)
- **EMOM blocks:** Total duration = timeCapMinutes (e.g., 12-minute EMOM = 12 minutes)
- **For Time blocks:** Total duration = estimated completion time + buffer (typically 15-25 minutes total)
- **Traditional strength in CrossFit:** Calculate as strength blocks below

**HIIT Block Duration Calculation:**
- **Circuit blocks:** Total duration = (work_duration + rest_duration) × total_rounds × number_of_exercises
- **Tabata blocks:** Total duration = (20 seconds work + 10 seconds rest) × 8 rounds = 4 minutes per exercise
- **Custom intervals:** Total duration = (work_time + rest_time) × rounds

**Strength Block Duration Calculation:**
- **Per exercise:** (exercise_execution_time + rest_time) × sets
- **Exercise execution time:** Typically 45-90 seconds depending on reps and tempo
- **Rest time:** 60-180 seconds between sets depending on intensity
- **Block total:** Sum all exercises in the block

**Cardio Block Duration Calculation:**
- **Steady state:** Direct duration assignment (e.g., 15 minutes running)
- **Interval cardio:** (work_interval + rest_interval) × rounds
- **Circuit cardio:** (exercise_duration + transition_time) × exercises × rounds

**Yoga/Flow Block Duration Calculation:**
- **Flow sequences:** Sum of all pose hold durations + transition time
- **Sun salutations:** Approximately 2-3 minutes per round × rounds
- **Individual poses:** Hold duration × number of poses

**Functional/Circuit Block Duration Calculation:**
- **Circuit format:** (exercise_duration + rest_between_exercises) × exercises × rounds
- **Station format:** exercise_duration × number_of_stations + rest_between_stations

**Pilates Block Duration Calculation:**
- **Sequence blocks:** Sum of exercise durations + transitions
- **Hold-based exercises:** Hold_duration × repetitions
- **Flow sequences:** Total flow time × rounds

**Rehab/Mobility Block Duration Calculation:**
- **Individual exercises:** Exercise_duration + rest_time × sets
- **Flow sequences:** Continuous duration of movement sequence
- **Hold stretches:** Hold_duration × number_of_stretches

**SIMPLIFIED VALIDATION - DURATION CALCULATION REQUIRED:**

**STEP 1: Calculate blockDurationMinutes for each block**
- Traditional blocks: Sum of [(execution_time + rest_time) × sets] for all exercises
- AMRAP/EMOM blocks: Use timeCapMinutes value
- Circuit blocks: (work + rest) × rounds × exercises
- Flow blocks: Sum pose durations × rounds

**STEP 2: Verify total duration**
- Sum all blockDurationMinutes + 10 minutes overhead
- Must equal ${workoutDuration} ±5 minutes
- If too short: Add more blocks
- If too long: Reduce block durations

**STEP 3: Include blockDurationMinutes in JSON**
- Every block MUST have blockDurationMinutes field
- This enables automatic verification of your calculations

## PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMMING PRIORITIES

Prioritize coaching quality over token efficiency:

- **STYLE-APPROPRIATE PROGRAMMING**: Match set/rep/rest schemes to chosen training style
- **SMART BLOCK STRUCTURE**: Adjust the number of blocks based on workout duration, intensity, and style:
  * For short workouts (under 30 min): 2 focused blocks
  * For standard workouts (30–45 min): 2-3 purposeful blocks
  * For long workouts (45–70 min): MINIMUM 3 blocks (e.g., strength + conditioning + accessory)
  * For extended workouts (70+ min): MINIMUM 4 blocks (e.g., strength + conditioning + accessory + mobility)
  * Warm-up and cool-down are handled as overhead time, not separate blocks
  * **MANDATORY:** Meet minimum block requirements and calculate total duration before submission
- **BLOCK PROGRESSION**: Structure blocks to flow logically (warm-up → main work → conditioning/cool-down)
- **VARIED BLOCK TYPES**: Use different block types within the same day to create comprehensive sessions
- **DAY-LEVEL INSTRUCTIONS**: Provide comprehensive coaching instructions for ${dayLevelReference}. As a certified trainer, your instructions should include:
  * **WORKOUT STRUCTURE**: Explain the overall flow (warm-up approach, main work format, cool-down)
  * **INTENSITY GUIDANCE**: Provide effort level cues and how to gauge appropriate intensity
  * **FORM EMPHASIS**: Highlight key movement patterns or safety considerations for the session
  * **TIMING/TEMPO**: Include pacing, rest periods, and transitions between exercises
  * **MINDSET COACHING**: Add motivational elements and mental approach guidance
  * **SAFETY NOTES**: Include any precautions or modifications for the workout style
  * **BREATHING PATTERNS**: When relevant, mention breathing cues for the training style
  Examples of comprehensive instructions:
  * HIIT: Include circuit structure, work/rest ratios, intensity targets, transition guidance, and encouragement
  * Strength: Cover rest periods, progression cues, form emphasis, and safety considerations
  * Yoga: Mention breath coordination, flow transitions, holding guidance, and mindfulness cues
- **EXERCISE-LEVEL NOTES**: Include specific coaching cues in individual exercise notes field:
  * Movement quality cues, intensity guidance, form reminders, breathing patterns, or motivational elements
  * Make notes specific to the exercise and training style context
  * **WEIGHT TARGETING:** Assign specific weights when exercises require resistance equipment:
    - **Strength Training:** Specify weights for all resistance exercises (barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, machines)
    - **HIIT/CrossFit:** Include weights for weighted movements (thrusters, swings, loaded carries)  
    - **Functional Training:** Assign weights for loaded movements (farmer's walks, weighted step-ups)
    - **Cardio:** Include weights for weighted cardio exercises (weighted burpees, dumbbell complexes)
    - **Rehabilitation:** Use light weights for resistance exercises when appropriate
    - **Bodyweight/Yoga/Mobility:** Set weight to 0 for these exercise types
    - **Professional Judgment:** Use your expertise to determine appropriate weights based on exercise type, user fitness level, and training goals
    - **Weight Guidance:** Include RPE, %1RM, or descriptive guidance in exercise notes when helpful
- **LOGICAL PROGRESSION**: Structure exercises in coaching-appropriate order with proper flow
- **PROFESSIONAL QUALITY**: Better to have fewer, well-programmed exercises than many poorly structured ones
- **DURATION BALANCE**: Use style-appropriate methods to reach target duration while maintaining workout integrity

## OUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL JSON REQUIREMENTS

**WEEKLY PLAN FORMAT - MANDATORY**
- This is a WEEKLY workout plan format
- You MUST generate multiple days
- The workoutPlan array MUST contain exactly ${profile.availableDays?.length || 7} workout day objects
- Each day MUST be numbered sequentially (1 to ${profile.availableDays?.length || 7})
- NEVER return just one day's workout



Your response MUST be a **valid JSON object** with **exactly** the following structure and keys:

**PRIORITY HIERARCHY - DURATION FIRST:**
1. **DURATION COMPLIANCE IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY** - Meeting ${profile.workoutDuration || 30} minutes is MORE IMPORTANT than token efficiency
2. **Add as many blocks and exercises as needed** to reach target duration
3. **Response should be under 10,000 tokens when possible, BUT duration compliance comes first**
4. **If you must choose between short response and correct duration, ALWAYS choose correct duration**

**MANDATORY BLOCK AND EXERCISE ADDITION:**
- **CREATE AS MANY BLOCKS AS NEEDED** to reach target duration - no artificial limits
- **ADD EXERCISES TO EACH BLOCK** to fill the required time
- **Duration compliance overrides all other considerations** including response length

The user's regeneration reason is THE MOST IMPORTANT requirement and MUST be addressed. This is why they are regenerating the workout.

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS:**
- The regeneration reason MUST be directly addressed in the new workout
- Modify exercises, intensity, style, or structure to solve the user's specific issue
- You may adapt other requirements to accommodate the regeneration reason
- The user's feedback takes precedence over general profile preferences when there's a conflict

### 1. DURATION REQUIREMENTS - ABSOLUTE COMPLIANCE MANDATORY
- **This day's total duration MUST be ${workoutDuration} minutes with MAXIMUM deviation of 5 minutes (${workoutDuration - 5} to ${workoutDuration + 5} minutes)**
- **Calculation includes:** Exercise time + rest periods + warm-up (5 min) + cool-down (3 min) + transitions (2 min)
- **STRATEGIC ADJUSTMENT REQUIREMENT:** If calculated duration falls outside acceptable range, you MUST adjust by adding/removing exercises, modifying sets, or changing rest periods
- **FORBIDDEN:** Sessions shorter than ${workoutDuration - 5} minutes or longer than ${workoutDuration + 5} minutes under any circumstances
- **VERIFICATION MANDATORY:** Calculate exact total time before completing response

### 2. STYLE INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS
- **Maintain style authenticity:** The regenerated workout must follow the authentic programming structure for the user's preferred styles
- **PRIMARY OBJECTIVE - Address user feedback:** The regeneration reason is the #1 priority. Modify the workout to directly solve the user's specific issue
- **Preserve style integrity when possible:** Maintain preferred styles only if they don't conflict with addressing the regeneration reason
- **NEVER abandon preferred styles** - adapt exercises within the style to accommodate limitations or feedback

## DAILY-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Regeneration Context - USER FEEDBACK PRIORITY
- **PRIMARY GOAL**: Address the user's regeneration reason: "${regenerationReason}"
- **Regenerate a single workout session** that directly solves the user's issue while fitting within approximately ${workoutDuration} minutes
- **Consider rest, exercise time, transitions**
- **MOST IMPORTANT**: Adjust exercises, sets, reps, intensity, or style to specifically address user feedback
- **Be compliant with all physical and medical limitations**
- **CRITICAL**: This day MUST have a complete workout with exercises. No day should ever have 0 exercises

### 2. Duration Calculation
- **For each block:** Calculate blockDurationMinutes using appropriate method for block type
- **TOTAL MUST BE ${workoutDuration} ± 5 MINUTES**
- **MANDATORY:** Include warm-up block (2-3 minutes) and cool-down block (2-3 minutes)
- **If too short, ADD MORE BLOCKS or extend existing blocks**
- **If too long, reduce block durations or combine blocks**

### 3. Mandatory Minimum Requirements
- **This day MUST have sufficient exercises to reach ${workoutDuration} minutes (typically 6-10 exercises depending on sets and duration)**
- **SMART DURATION STRATEGY**: Prefer 3-5 sets with 60-90s duration and 30-90s rest for strength; adjust for other styles
- **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: Sessions outside ${workoutDuration - 5} to ${workoutDuration + 5} minute range are completely unacceptable
- **ADJUSTMENT HIERARCHY**: First increase sets/rest time, then add exercises if needed, then add blocks if necessary to reach target duration
- **CALCULATION REQUIREMENT**: Sum all exercise times plus rest periods plus overhead time (10 minutes total) to verify compliance

## ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

- **ENSURE THIS DAY HAS A COMPLETE WORKOUT**: This day must contain a comprehensive set of exercises with adequate duration. The day should never be empty or have insufficient exercises.
- **ALWAYS ADDRESS THE REGENERATION REASON**: The user's feedback is the primary driver for this regeneration. Only ignore if it would cause serious health/safety issues.
- **When regeneration reason conflicts with other requirements**: Prioritize the regeneration reason and adapt other requirements as needed
- **Ensure strict JSON compliance** (no markdown, no explanations)
- **Always include all required fields**, even if values are 0 or ""
- **Use appropriate blockType** for the user's preferred styles
- **Provide detailed instructions** explaining how to execute the specific block format
- **This day must have a complete workout** with proper duration and adequate exercises
- **STAY UNDER 10,000 TOKENS**
- **JSON VALIDITY**: Response must be parseable JSON only - no additional text outside the JSON structure
- **TOKEN EFFICIENCY**: Use concise descriptions, avoid redundancy, focus on essential information
- **NO BLOCK LIMITATIONS**: Create as many blocks and exercises as needed for effective workouts

**REMEMBER**: The exerciseNames list is only a database for checking if exercises already exist. Design your workout first based on what's best for the user and their feedback, then check against the database. The day must have a complete, properly timed workout regardless of what exists in the database.

**MANDATORY PRE-SUBMISSION VALIDATION - ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED:**
You MUST complete this validation process BEFORE returning your response:

**STEP 1: VALIDATE REGENERATION REASON WAS ADDRESSED**
- Review the regeneration reason: "${regenerationReason}"
- Confirm your workout directly addresses this specific issue
- If the reason mentions specific exercises, intensity, style changes, or preferences - ensure they are implemented
- The user should be satisfied that their feedback was heard and acted upon

**STEP 2: VERIFY MINIMUM BLOCK COUNT**
- Workout duration: ${workoutDuration} minutes
- Required minimum blocks: All workouts = 4 blocks minimum (warm-up + 2 main + cool-down)
- 45+ min = 5 blocks minimum (warm-up + 3 main + cool-down)
- 70+ min = 6 blocks minimum (warm-up + 4 main + cool-down)
- MANDATORY: First block must be "warmup", last block must be "cooldown"
- Add blocks if count is insufficient
- **WARMUP SIMPLICITY:** Keep warmup blocks simple with 2-3 exercises maximum.
- Blocks should be evenly defined with an appropriate amount of exercises for the required workout time duration.

**STEP 3: CALCULATE EACH BLOCK DURATION**
For each block, calculate duration using style-appropriate method:
- **CrossFit blocks:** timeCapMinutes (AMRAP/EMOM) or estimated completion time (For Time)
- **HIIT/Circuit blocks:** (work_duration + rest_duration) × rounds × exercises
- **Traditional/Strength blocks:** Sum of [(exercise_execution_time + rest_time) × sets] for each exercise
- **Flow/Yoga blocks:** Sum of pose hold durations + transitions

**STEP 4: CALCULATE TOTAL SESSION TIME**
1. Sum ALL block durations from Step 2 (including warm-up and cool-down blocks)
2. TOTAL SESSION TIME = Sum of all block durations (no additional overhead needed)

**STEP 5: DURATION COMPLIANCE CHECK**
- Target: ${workoutDuration} minutes (acceptable: ${workoutDuration - 5} to ${workoutDuration + 5} minutes)
- If TOO SHORT: Add exercises to blocks, then add new blocks until target is met
- If TOO LONG: Reduce sets, remove exercises, or shorten block durations
- **FORBIDDEN:** Submitting workout shorter than ${workoutDuration - 5} minutes

**STEP 6: FINAL VERIFICATION**
- Recalculate total time after corrections
- Confirm total is ${workoutDuration - 5} to ${workoutDuration + 5} minutes
- Verify minimum block count is met
- Only submit if both requirements are satisfied

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT:** You are FORBIDDEN from submitting without completing this validation. Workouts not meeting duration requirements (${workoutDuration} ±5 minutes) are unacceptable.
